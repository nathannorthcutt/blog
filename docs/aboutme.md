Hi there! I'm Nathan and for the past 17 years I've been developing software for a lot of different companies using as many languages as possible. I haven't gotten around to everything just yet, but I'm slowly making my way through them as the opportunities arise. One of the main reasons that I like to explore new workplaces, coding languages and design patterns is the opportunity to learn new ways to do things that I can bring back to other situations in the future. As an architect at several stops in my career, this has been invaluable since your job is more about general problem solving and having more tools and tricks is a huge plus.

Besides coding and talking about technology in general, I really love to travel the world and explore different cultures and food. Depending on the country, that split can quickly tilt towards one or the other but I always love to get a bit of both in when I can (Singapore was soooo much good food...). I'm also a huge fan of hiking and am equally happy doing that in a city or out in the country enjoying nature and a bit of space.

As far as passions in the technology space, I really enjoy platform engineering and accelerating teams through frameworks that make their day to day lives easier. Resource optimization and scalability are two things that folks who know me will attest to hearing about, perhaps too much at times but are areas where I love to play. Generally I'm head first into problems as they arise and work with a lot of different teams to deal with production issues, keeping everyone focused but upbeat where possible. We usually arrive at a solution together so I try to enjoy the experience and then figure out how to prevent it from coming up again.
